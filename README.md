### Set up a local instance
• Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed  
• Download repository, `cd` into it and run `npm i`. This will install all the necessary dependencies  
• If you want to you can create `.env` file in the same directory where `server.js` file is, and add a `PORT` variable. This is the port on which the server is going to listen. Default port is `3000`  
• Run the app with `node server.js`
