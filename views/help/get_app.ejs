					<h3>Here is copy pasta from <a href="https://ruqqus.com/help/oauth" target="blank">ruqqus's help page</a></h3>
					<hr>
					<p>In the <a href="https://ruqqus.com/settings/apps" target="blank">apps tab of Ruqqus settings</a>, fill in and submit the form to
						request new API keys. You will need:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>an application name</li>
						<li>a Redirect URI, or a comma-separated list of redirect URIs. May not use HTTP unless using
							localhost (use HTTPS instead).</li>
						<li>a brief description of what your application is intended to do</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Don't worry too much about accuracy; you will be able to change all of these later.</p>
					<p>Ruqqus administrators will review and approve or deny your request for API keys. You'll know when
						your request has been approved when a client ID and secret appear in your application
						information.</p>
					<p>DO NOT reveal your Client Secret. Anyone with your Client Secret will be able to pretend to be
						you. You are responsible for keeping your Client Secret a secret!</p>
